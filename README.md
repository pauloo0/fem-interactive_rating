## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS Superset
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindui.com) - CSS framework

### What I learned

Making this project, I found it quite tricky to get the gradient working, and probably it isn't 100% equal to the design provided.
I used semantic HTML5 markup to build the component. Also got working again with react states, good reminder, as I hadn't used them in about a month or month and a half.
